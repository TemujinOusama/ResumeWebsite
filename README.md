# ResumeWebsite
Hello to whoever is reading this. I am Lariwell Rodrigueza, a graduate of BS Computer Science. This is my very first web creation as I have 
just finished learning html and css about 3 days before its creation. 
I am going to use this as means of showing my resume to employers while also providing them some interactivity as they navigate my resume.
Have a Good Day!
